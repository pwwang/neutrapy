# neutrapy

A CLI tools to build desktop applications with [Neutralinojs][1] and Python as backend
<hr />

`neutrapy` maintains both the frontend and backend of the application and creates a universal configuration file for the application. You can use `neutrapy sync` to syncronize the configurations to `neutralino.config.json`, `pyproject.toml` and `<name>.bzl` for [`PyOxidizer`][3] to build the backend into a binary.

## Example

![example](./example.png)

The example is generated by `neutrapy create -n example`. It isn't the same as the offical example, called [litePy][4], from Neutralinojs. The official one saves the code into a temporary file and executes it by spawn a python process each time the code is received. This one is implemented as a Neutralino extension written in Python and uses [websocket_client][5] to communicate with the Neutralino server.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install -U neutrapy
# Installs the latest version of neutrapy
```

## Usage

### Checking the requirements

```bash
$ neutrapy check
# Checks if neu-cli, poetry and pyoxidizer are installed
```

### Creating a new project

```bash
$ neutrapy create -n <name>
# Creates a new project with the name <name>
```

### Syncronizing the configurations

```bash
$ neutrapy sync
# Syncronizes the configurations to neutralino.config.json, pyproject.toml and <name>.bzl
```

### Running the application

$ neutrapy run
# Runs the application

$ neutrapy build
# Builds the application
```
